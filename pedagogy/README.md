#### 1. Focus Area : The main focus area of this project is to design,maintain and changing data in database by using data manipulation commands by recalling our previous concepts.
we are also focusing on all the key factors which are necessary for the completion of the project like-using practical skills,doing various experiments and understanding the concept behind the experiment for gaining the accurate results.
